**Notes for the reader**

In this mini-project, we are exploring subtype polymorphism by extending the AsciiBlock class to handle more complex text layouts. We are implementing classes such as Grid, HComp, VComp, HFlip, VFlip, Trimmed, and Padded to manipulate ASCII blocks, ensuring they adapt to changes in the underlying blocks. Additionally, we're developing a custom block type 'BezierCurveStamp' and implementing the eqv method for each Asciiblock, which compares blocks based on how they were constructed, rather than just their appearance. The main method of this project displays an artwork in which we use multiple types of AsciiBlocks.
